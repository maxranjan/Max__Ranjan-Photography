        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> 1. Make sure you have quality equipment.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's hard to take high-quality shots if your gear isn't up to snuff. Get a camera that provides plenty of
            customization options. Make sure your camera accessories can stand up to the elements, and that any portable
            lighting is sturdy. Buy specialized lenses if you want unusual photographs, such as waterproof lenses for
            underwater shots. Think about what photo effects might improve images, then find the equipment and software
            programs that make them possible.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Pick your focal point.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ask yourself what your photo subject is and then focus on it. Make sure your camera keeps your subject in
            focus as well. Get close to your subject if you can, especially if it's a person. Move in until it fills the
            frame. Certain digital cameras and smartphone cameras help with this by locking onto the subject. Then you
            can blur the background or reduce camera shake to maintain a clear, sharp view.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            3. Learn the rule of thirds.
            <br>
            <br>
            The rule of thirds states you should divide your shot into three equal parts both vertically and
            horizontally. Then, place your subject or more important details off-center, leaving the other two-thirds
            open. This makes for an interesting photograph and helps draw the viewer's eye into the whole composition
            rather than just the center. It can also help to highlight an unusual background and convey more of a
            feeling of motion than a centered image. Many digital cameras and cameras on cell phones have a setting that
            helps you with this by displaying a grid over your view.


            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Change your angles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't be afraid to move around rather than shooting your subject head on. You can often produce interesting
            perspectives this way. Create good depth of field or quirky moods by taking pictures from high, low or
            skewed angles. If you have trouble getting the angle you want, a stationary or opposable camera tripod may
            help.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            5. Pay attention to framing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Framing is a technique that can help you take great photos. It involves finding something that can create a
            natural frame to direct the viewer's attention to the subject of the photo. Doorways, walls, cliffs, arches
            and trees often work well. If the frame is quite close to the camera, it can act as a foreground layer and
            add more depth to the image. If you fill the frame, the subject sometimes creates its own framing,
            especially if you're taking a portrait shot.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            6. Look for ideal lighting.
            <br>
            <br>
            Natural lighting is ideal for high-quality photos. You can get great natural lighting in the morning or
            before sunset during times known as the "golden hours." Of course, if you can't manage natural lighting,
            consider getting artificial sources. Look into studio lights or ring lights that let you adjust the
            brightness to your preferences. Try to use these lighting options rather than a flash, which can wash out
            color and cause lower-quality shots. This is especially true for indoor photography.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            7. Use filters and settings.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most cameras come with adjustable settings or preset filters that provide interesting effects. Experiment
            with aperture, contrast, exposure or color cancellation before you take a shot. You can also purchase lens
            filters that can help minimize reflection and glare, enhance colors and add more impact to your images. If
            you want to figure out how to take good photos with a phone, find out what settings your phone camera has.
            You may find that you can achieve many of the same effects as with a traditional digital camera.


            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            8. Take multiple shots.
            <br>
            <br>
            Even if you think you took a great photo, always take a few more just to be safe. Test out various angles,
            try different poses if you're capturing a model at a photo shoot and don't be afraid of rapid-fire
            photography. Take the same photo, but with different settings or effects. Try taking photos of things you
            wouldn't normally shoot, even around your own home. This helps you get used to your gear and develop your
            own unique style.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            9. Simple backgrounds make good portraits.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pay close attention to backgrounds when you take photos. Busy backgrounds can put too much on the screen,
            making a shot feel jumbled and distracting. When taking a picture of a person, use simple backgrounds
            instead to put all the attention on your model. You can also blur backgrounds during the editing process, so
            they appear simpler.


            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            10. Take your time editing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you have your photos, you can still bring them up a notch with thoughtful editing. Some cameras allow
            you to edit right there, but it may be easier to edit on your computer. Get a smartphone app or photo
            editing software that allows you to play with cropping, colors and effects. Tweak various aspects of your
            photo until you think it's right. You can then print the final product using a photo printer or share the
            digital version online.

            Getting started with photography doesn't have to feel stressful if you know a few simple techniques and have
            a willingness to experiment. New angles, editing tricks, focus points and proper framing can all contribute
            to shots that look more professional. Get used to your gear and follow these photography tips and tricks to
            make simple changes and advance your skills.
